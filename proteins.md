Here are displayed the counts of peptides in each protein and phenotype. 

###### Peptides are counted depending on the method of filtering. Selected number of peptides with minimum/maximum InROPE values are counted when this method of filtering is applied. In case of density plot filtering, the counts represent the number of relevant peptides (below the InROPE threshold). 
###### Further filtering is possible within the table, using fields below the header. You can also export your filtered data to CSV format, copy them or print by clicking on appropriate button above the table.
