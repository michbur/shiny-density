Here you can filter data using **Density plot** - visualisation of data distribution over the InROPE values or **Minimum/maximum values** of InROPE. The filtering is possible on:
- **peptide level** - showing all the peptides above/below the threshold or minimum/maximum values of inROPE 
- **protein level** - showing all the proteins which peptides are above/below the threshold or with minimum/maximum InROPE medians

###### Further filtering is possible within the table, using fields below the header. You can also export your filtered data to CSV format, copy them or print by clicking on appropriate button above the table. 

For analysis of peptide counts on protein level go to "Proteins" tab.

- muDiff - the difference in means of groups
- effSz - the effect size
- InROPE - the percentage of the posterior probability mass within the region
