Here you can filter data using **Density plot** - visualisation of data distribution over the InROPE values, **Minimum/maximum values** of InROPE or filter peptides on **Protein level** selecting proteins of a given type and number of peptides.

###### Further filtering is possible within the table, using fields below the header. You can also export your filtered data to CSV format, copy them or print by clicking on appropriate button above the table. 

For analysis of peptide counts on protein level go to "Proteins" tab.
