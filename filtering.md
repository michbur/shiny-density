Here you can filter data using **Density plot** - visualisation of data distribution over the InROPE values or **Minimum/maximum values** of InROPE.

###### Further filtering is possible within the table, using fields below the header. You can also export your filtered data to CSV format, copy them or print by clicking on appropriate button above the table. 

For analysis on protein level go to "Proteins" tab.
